# Conway's Game of Charm 

In order to get a better sense of the [charm bubble tea library](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) I will be making the classic
conway's game of life with it

It can be downloaded by using the following command

```shell
go install github.com/e-mar404/charm-conway@latest
```

To "play" the game it is as simple as running the command `charm-conway`. It
will start a 1 minute game refreshing every 150ms.
